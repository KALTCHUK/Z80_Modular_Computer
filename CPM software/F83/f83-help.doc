                    Getting Started with F83

                         by Greg McCall


  The  documentation  with  F83 is in F83.COM and in  the  shadow 
screens that are part of the source files that come with F83.  At 
a glance, the thought of sifting through hundreds of kilobytes of 
shadow screens is bewildering to say the least.  Just to get  you 
started,  I  have  put together a summary of how to use the  file 
words  and how to edit these files.  This relates to the  CP/M-80 
version  of  F83,  but as far as I know it should be  similar  to 
other versions of Laxen and Perry's F83.

 This Forth can have two files open at once.  One file is  called 
the  CURRENT file.  This is the file used by all normal reads and 
writes.  You  would normally edit or load from the CURRENT  file. 
The other file is called the FROM file. This is a second file you 
may have open for reading only. For example, if you are currently 
working on a file (i.e.,  loading and editing),  and you wish  to 
load  some  screens from another file,  then you may open a  FROM 
file and load screens from it without changing the CURRENT  file. 
Following is a description of some useful file words:

CREATE-FILE    (S n -- )
               Creates a new file containing n blocks. 10 CREATE-
               FILE  TEST.BLK  opens a file called  test.blk  and 
               writes ten blank screens to this file. The file is 
               then closed.

FILE?          Prints the name of the CURRENT file.

DIR            Prints the directory of the current drive.

OPEN           Open  the  following  file name and  make  it  the  
               current file, e.g., OPEN TEST.BLK

FROM           Make  the  next word in the input stream the  FROM 
               file and OPEN it. It then sets the current vocabu-
               lary to FILES.

LOAD           In  the FORTH vocabulary,  LOAD will load  screens 
               from  the CURRENT file.  In the FILES  vocabulary, 
               LOAD  will  load screens from the  FROM  file.  So 
               while we have a file as the CURRENT file,  we  can 
               still open another file by making this second file 
               the  FROM  file and loading from  it,  e.g.,  FROM 
               TEST.BLK 10 LOAD

CA             Copy a screen to its shadow.

COPY           (S from to -- )
               In  the FORTH vocabulary,  copies a screen in  the 
               CURRENT file.  In the FILES vocabulary,  copies  a 
               screen from the FROM file to the CURRENT file.  In 
               the  SHADOW  vocabulary,  copies a screen and  its 
               shadow in the CURRENT file.

CONVEY         (S from to -- )
               In the FORTH vocabulary,  copies a set of  screens 
               in  the  CURRENT file.  In the  FILES  vocabulary, 
               copies  a set of screens from the FROM file to the 
               CURRENT file.  In the SHADOW vocabulary,  copies a 
               set  of screens and their shadows in  the  CURRENT 
               file.

HOPPED         A  variable  containing the number of  screens  to 
               skip when copying with CONVEY.

U/D            A  variable containing the direction of the screen 
               move using CONVEY. +1 is a forward screen move and 
               -1 is a backward screen move.

TO             Sets  up  the variables HOPPED and  U/D.  Used  as 
               first-source   last-source  TO   first-destination 
               CONVEY

  The  F83  editor uses the same words as the editor in  Starting 
Forth  by Leo Brodie,  with some additions such as the  word  NEW 
which  allows  replacement of multiple lines.  To get the  editor 
going  correctly,  you  should look at screens 28 - 30 and  88 of 
ULITITY.BLK  which hold the terminal-dependent routines.  You can 
select your terminal - or see if any of the routines are the same 
as  those  of  your terminal - or write  your  own  routines. The 
terminal words patch the words AT,  DARK,  BLOT and -LINE to suit 
your terminal.  While we are looking at patching the editor,  you 
could  remove  the  backslash in line 14 of  screen  24  so  that 
(WHERE) is patched into WHERE and, if you have a real-time clock, 
then  you  could change GET-ID in screen 23 so as to have  the ID 
supplied  when the editor is first invoked.  These screen numbers 
refer  to  the CP/M-80 version of F83.  To find where  the source 
screens  are  for the editor in your Forth,  type VIEW  AT  which 
should give you the second source screen of your editor. Now just 
look through the editor's screens for the required words.

  A summary of the editor commands follows:

TOP            Go to the top of the screen.

C              (S n -- )
               Move n characters, right or left.

T              (S n -- )
               Go to beginning of line n.

.BUFS          Displays  the  contents  of the  insert  and  find 
               buffers.

KEEP           Places the current line in the insert buffer.

K              Exchanges  the  contents of the  insert  and  find 
               buffers.

W              Write all changes to disk.

N              Move to next screen.

B              Move back a screen.

A              Alternate between a screen and its shadow.

<text>         Represents  the  text following  the  command.  If 
               <text> is just a carriage return,  the contents of 
               the  insert buffer is used in place of the missing 
               <text>.

I <text>       Inserts <text> on the current line at the cursor.

O <text>       Overwrites <text> onto the current line.

P <text>       Replaces the current line with <text> and blanks.

U <text>       Inserts a line under the current line.

F <text>       Finds  the <text> and leaves the cursor just  pass 
               it.

S <text>       (S n -- )
               Searches  for <text> through all screens from  the 
               current one up to screen n.  Each time a match  is 
               found,  n  remains on the stack until screen n  is 
               reached. To continue the search, just type S until 
               screen n is reached.

R <text>       Replaces the text just found with <text>.

D <text>       Finds and deletes the text.

TILL <text>    Deletes all text on the line from the cursor up to 
               and including <text>.

JUST <text>    Deletes up to, but not including, <text>.

KT <text>      Puts all text between the cursor and <text> inclu-
               sive into the insert buffer ("keep-till").

E              Erases the text just found with by F or S.

X              Deletes the current line.

SPLIT          Breaks the current line in two at the cursor.

JOIN           Puts a copy of the next line after the cursor.

WIPE           Clears the screen to blanks.

G              (S screen line -- )
               Gets  a line from another screen and inserts it in 
               front of the current line.  In the shadow  vocabu-
               lary,  G gets a line and its shadow . In the FILES 
               vocabulary, G gets the line from the FROM file.

BRING          (S screen first last -- )
               Brings  several  lines  from  another  screen  and 
               inserts them in front of the current line.  In the 
               SHADOW vocabulary, BRING gets a range of lines and 
               their shadows. In the FILES vocabulary, BRING gets 
               the lines from the FROM file.

NEW            (S n -- )
               Moves the terminal's cursor to the start of line n 
               and  overwrites  until the line has a null  input, 
               i.e., just a carriage return.

QUIT           Exits the editor without updating or flushing.

DONE           Exits the editor,  updates the ID stamp, tells you 
               if the screen was modified, flushes it to disk and 
               removes automatic redisplay.

ED             Re-enters the editor.  It clears and reinitialises 
               the display, and begins automatic redisplay of the 
               screen.

EDIT           (S n -- )
               Sets SCR to n, then uses ED to start the editing.


  This  should enable you to copy and edit screens with Laxen and 
Perry's F83. The best way to get the entire documentation on this 
Forth  is by printing out all the source files.  If your  printer 
can  print at least 132 characters per line,  then look  in  your 
printer's manual for the characters needed to put your printer in 
this mode. My FAX-80 needs a control-O to set the condensed mode.
I  define  a word FAX-80 to send this code and then patch it into 
the DEFERed word INIT-PR, i.e.,:

: FAX-80  CONTROL O  EMIT  ;
' FAX-80 IS INIT-PR

  To  print  the  entire file,  you use  the  word  LISTING.  For 
example, to list META80.BLK, I would type:

OPEN META80.BLK LISTING
