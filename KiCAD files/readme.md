## What you'll find in this directory ##
Each subdirectory contains the KiCAD files for a specific Proton card. (Except "/AVRisp 328p adapter", "/EProg", "/generic grid" and "/stickers"). They all contain the circuit diagrams. Most of them also have the PCB layouts and some even have the Gerber files I sent to the PCB manufacturers (PCBway and JLC PCB)).
