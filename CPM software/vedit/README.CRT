VEDIT PLUS                                                    Appendix A
                                                               CRT Notes


                    IMPORTANT NOTES FOR CRT VERSIONS


                   (Televideo Users: See next page!!)


The  CRT versions of VEDIT PLUS are very generic in that they can run on
almost any hardware configuration.  They are primarily  intended  to  be
used  with CRT terminals connected to a micro-computer.  (The connection
may be direct, via a network, or over a telephone line.)

Although the CRT versions will even run on an IBM PC, whenever possible,
you should use a "memory mapped" version for the IBM PC, Tandy 2000, DEC
Rainbow, Wang PC and TI Professional.  The memory mapped  versions  have
the  advantage  of  updating the screen about 10 to 20 times faster than
CRT versions.  Please contact us if you receive a CRT version  when  you
should have a memory mapped version. 

VEDIT  PLUS  supports  "windows"  on  CRT terminals.  Screen updating is
faster if the terminal has "Insert Line" and "Delete  Line"  capability.
Fortunately,   most   terminals  and  the  Z-100  have  this.   On  some
(relatively obscure) MS-DOS machines you will have to install the MS-DOS
ANSI.SYS driver to run VEDIT PLUS.  Unfortunately, most ANSI.SYS do  not
support  Insert  Line/Delete line.  This slows down screen updating when
using windows. 

When using "windows"  with  the  CRT  versions,  you  will  find  screen
updating  faster  when  using vertical (top/bottom) windows.  Horizontal
(left/right) windows can also be used, but scrolling then requires  that
the  entire  window  be  rewritten.  Remember that you can edit multiple
files without having to split the screen into windows. 

If your terminal (computer) does not scroll properly with VEDIT PLUS, it
is often due to incorrect installation for the "Number of Screen Lines".
Some terminals and computers have  25  line  displays,  others  have  24
lines. 

Please contact us if you have any questions concerning the compatibility
of VEDIT PLUS with your machine. 


If  you  have  MS-DOS and a hard disk you should create the subdirectory
"\VEDIT" on the hard  disk  and  copy  all  files  to  it.   Follow  the
directions  under  "Setting  up VEDIT PLUS on an IBM PC-XT or AT" in the
Introduction. 


                  IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT "STATUS LINES"

The "status line" on the Zenith Z19 and Televideo 950 terminals  is  not
supported.  They must be installed as 24 line terminals.

VEDIT PLUS                                                    Appendix A
                                                               CRT Notes


                IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT TELEVIDEO TERMINALS

(For models 910, 912, 920, 925 and 950)

Most  Televideo  terminals  (and terminals emulating a Televideo) do not
support reverse  video  on  individual  characters.   (A  reverse  video
character is surrounded by two blank spaces.) Therefore, VEDIT PLUS does
not support reverse video on these terminals.  Without reverse video, it
is  impossible  to  see the location of the cursors in multiple windows.
(The main cursor is always visible.)

However, VEDIT PLUS can display the text using the "dim" attribute,  and
display  messages,  the status line and multiple cursors in the "normal"
attribute.  This may require an intensity adjustment  when  using  VEDIT
PLUS, but is the preferred setup. 

Therefore,  the CRT Installation menu has multiple entries for Televideo
terminals.  Those marked "DIM" use the  "dim"  attribute  feature.   The
alternate entries do not use reverse video or dim characters. 

To improve the visibility of the status line, you may want to display it
with  dashes  "-".   This  is  selected by setting Task 7.4 to "2D" hex.
Task 7.5 should also be set to "2D" hex. 

Note:  The Televideo models 914,  924  and  970  support  reverse  video
       properly.   Therefore,  the  above  discussion  does not apply to
       them.  The 914/924 entry is marked with "REVERSE" as  a  reminder
       that  reverse video is supported.  The 970 user should select the
       "ANSI 3.64" entry. 

Note:  Since the BACKSPACE key on most  Televideo  terminals  sends  the
       same code as "Left Arrow" key, the [BACKSPACE] function cannot be
       assigned to the BACKSPACE key. 


                 IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT WYSE 50 TERMINALS

The  Wyse  50  can  emulate  Televideo  terminals, but then has the same
problem with reverse video  characters.   However,  VEDIT  PLUS  uses  a
"trick"  to  support  reverse video in the WY50 mode - it writes reverse
video characters as "protected characters" without  entering  "protected
mode".  For this to work you must set up the terminal as follows:

WYSE 50 Setup:

        PROT = REV

        COMPATIBLE MODE = WY50

You  can  optionally  install  VEDIT  PLUS  to support the WY50 with 132
columns.  Select the WYSE 50 (132 COLUMN) from  the  CRT  menu  AND  set
installation Task 10.2 to 132.

                                                               CRT Notes


                      INSTALLING THE CRT VERSIONS

The  CRT  versions are NOT supplied ready to run since we have no way of
knowing what hardware configuration you have.  Therefore,  there  is  no
".COM"  file  on  your disk, but rather a ".SET" file.  You must perform
the installation before you can use VEDIT PLUS for the first time. 

Give the DOS command:

     INSTALL VPLUS86C.SET VPLUS.COM

Initially you only have to perform Step 2 of the Installation  on  pages
299  -  300  in  the  manual.   This will give you the "Default Keyboard
Layout" listed later in this file. 




                  IMPORTANT NOTE FOR NEC APC AND Z-100

The function keys on the NEC  APC  and  Zenith  Z-100  can  send  8  bit
characters, i.e.  characters which have their "high" bit set.  To enable
these functions keys for editing purposes you must set Task 7.2 to a "0"
during Installation.  (Note: Task 7.2 has a totally different meaning on
the IBM PC.  The manual describes the IBM PC meaning.)

                                                               CRT Notes




               NOTES FOR HEATH H19 / ZENITH Z19 TERMINALS


The example keyboard layout assumes that the terminal is in the  "Heath"
mode and not in the ANSI mode.  VEDIT PLUS and INSTALL automatically put
the keypad into "Alternate Keypad Mode" and disable this mode on exit. 

You  may  experience extra characters appearing when using the cursor UP
and DOWN keys, especially in conjunction with the REPEAT key.   This  is
caused  by the function keys sending their multi character codes at 9600
Baud, which is too fast for non-interrupt driven software.  This is best
solved by making your system interrupt driven.  If this is not possible,
implement the cursor movements  with  control  characters  and  use  the
keypad  for other functions.  It may help to reduce the entered value in
Task 8.8 (relating to processor speed) during Installation,  or  to  use
the "Shifted Keypad Mode". 

If you are using your terminal at the undocumented 19,200 baud, you will
need  to modify the CRT terminal entry (see NEWCRT.DOC) and increase the
delays for EOS, EOL, INSERT LINE and DELETE LINE.  The cursor addressing
will also require a delay of about 4 milliseconds. 

Note:  The 25th status line  on  the  H19/Z19  is  not  supported.   The
       H19/Z19 must be installed as a 24 line terminal. 



                            NOTES FOR Z-100


Be sure you have installed TASK 7.2 to a value of "0". 

VEDIT  PLUS  automatically  puts  the Z-100 into a mode of "disabled key
expansion" since this allows maximum flexibility in the keyboard layout.
In particular, it allows use of the Shifted arrow keys, and the  use  of
[CANCEL] in Command Mode. 

Normal  key  expansion  is  restored when VEDIT PLUS is exited.  INSTALL
also puts the Z-100 into this mode.  (The Z100SET file used in  previous
versions of VEDIT PLUS is no longer needed.)
