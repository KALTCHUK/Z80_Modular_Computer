
		SUPPORTING NEW CRT TERMINALS

This file explains how to use the supplied program INTMOD to add 
a new CRT terminal to the INSTALL menu of  supported  terminals. 
INTMOD  can  also  be  used  to  change the table entries for an 
existing terminal.  If your  CRT  terminal  is  already  on  the 
INSTALL menu, it is unlikely that you will need to use INTMOD.

To use INTMOD, you will need the following items:

1)  A  copy  of  INTMOD.EXE  and  INSTALL.INI  on  your  default 
    (logged-in)  disk  drive.   (INTMOD.COM  for  CP/M  systems, 
    INTMOD.CMD for CP/M-86). 

2)  A list of Control or Escape sequences used by your  terminal 
    or computer for controlling the display (consult your user's 
    manual).

3)  An ASCII conversion chart.

The file INSTALL.INI contains the names and associated tables of 
Escape   sequences  for  the  supported  CRT  Terminals.   These 
sequences are used by the program INSTALL to customize VEDIT  to 
run on a particular machine or terminal.

INTMOD   allows   you   to  work  interactively  with  the  file 
INSTALL.INI.  New terminal entries can be added, while  existing 
entries can be modified, deleted, displayed, or printed.

The  INTMOD  program contains on-line help messages which should 
give the information necessary to effectively use  the  program.  
Note  that  any  changes  made  (including  adding  or  deleting 
terminal entries) are not permanent until you  exit  INTMOD  and 
specify that changes are to be saved.


ADDING OR MODIFYING A CRT TABLE ENTRY
-------------------------------------

At the operating system prompt, type:

	INTMOD<RETURN>  

INTMOD  will  display  a  brief  description of  its  operation,  
followed by the main options menu:

    INTMOD : Modification Options 

	0. EXIT Program without update 
	1. DISPLAY terminal entries 
	2. ADD a  new terminal entry 
	3. DELETE existing terminal entry 
	4. MODIFY existing terminal entry 
	5. PRINT ONE or ALL entries

    Enter option number  (DISPLAY terminal entries) 

At the prompt, type the  number  of  your  selected  option.   A 
default  selection  is  displayed  in  parentheses  and  can  be 
selected by typing <RETURN>.


0. EXIT Program without update 
------------------------------
This  option  allows  you  to  exit  INTMOD at any point without 
saving changes you have made.  Each of the other options  allows 
you to exit and save the changes to disk.


1. DISPLAY terminal entries
--------------------------- 
This option displays an alphabetical list of currently supported 
terminals.   At this point you can type the number corresponding 
to the terminal entry you wish to work with, or exit back to the 
main  menu.   The terminal you select in this option will be the 
default terminal for all other options.

You can select this option to save your changes to disk.


2. ADD a new terminal entry
---------------------------
This  option  allows  you  to  create an all-new terminal entry.  
INTMOD will prompt you for the name of the new  terminal,  which 
can  be up to 30 characters long.  INTMOD then asks if you would 
like to initialize the new table from an existing entry.  If you 
answer   yes   to  this  prompt,  INTMOD  asks  for  the  number 
corresponding to that entry.  

Assuming the name you entered for the new entry does not already 
exist,  INTMOD  creates it and initializes the table to the same 
values as in the existing entry chosen above, or initializes all 
values  to  zero if no existing entry was used.  If the name for 
the new table already exists, INTMOD issues an error message.

It is usually easier to create a new entry from an existing one, 
rather that starting completely from scratch.  Try to  choose  a 
terminal that is close to the one you ultimately want.  Once you 
have created a new terminal entry, you can proceed to the MODIFY 
option.

Note:  INTMOD  automatically re-sorts the list of terminals into 
alphabetical order, so the number corresponding to some  entries 
may  change.  It is a good idea to DISPLAY the list of terminals 
again before proceeding.


3. DELETE existing terminal entry
---------------------------------
This option allows you to remove an unwanted terminal entry from 
the  menu.  INTMOD will prompt for the number of the terminal to 
be deleted (defaults  to terminal  chosen  in  DISPLAY  option).  
Since  this  option  will  cause  the  list  of  terminals to be 
re-sorted, the number corresponding to some entries may change.


4. MODIFY existing terminal entry 
---------------------------------
This option allows you to change  one  or  more  of  the  escape 
sequences  in  a specific table.  Use this option to 'fine tune' 
an existing table or a new table ADDed  with  option  2.   After 
selecting  the  MODIFY  option,  you  will  be  prompted  with a 
sub-menu of terminal control functions (see notes below).  Enter 
the  number  corresponding  to  the function you wish to modify.  
You will be asked  to  enter  the  hexadecimal  values  for  the 
characters in the sequence.  Typing <RETURN> when asked to enter 
a new value will keep the original setting.

After modifying a table entry, you have  the  option  of  making 
additional  changes to the entry, returning to the main menu, or 
exiting INTMOD.

5. PRINT ONE or ALL entries
---------------------------
With this option, you can print the current values in a specific 
table entry, or optionally, all table entries.


NOTES:
------
Below is an example CRT table entry.  Each table consists of  16 
control  sequences  of  up  to  7  bytes, plus cursor addressing 
information (ADDOFF) of 3 bytes.  Each control  sequence  begins 
with  a  count byte of the number of characters in the sequence, 
followed by those characters,  followed  by  a  delay  byte  (in 
milliseconds).  

Most of the functions in the table  should be  self-explanatory.  
Those which may not be so obvious are described below.

CURSOR ADDRESSING  is  broken  down  into  three  parts:  Cursor 
Leadin, Characters between X and Y, and Cursor Lead Out.   These 
are best described by example.  In the table below, the sequence 
for direct cursor addressing is "ESC [ r ; c H",  where  'r'  is 
the  row  and `c` is the column.  In this example, Cursor Leadin 
is "ESC [", Chars between X and Y is ";", and Cursor Lead Out is 
"H".

ADDOFF  is a three byte sequence that performs several functions 
related to cursor addressing.  Byte one determines  whether  the 
row or column value is sent first, and also whether these values 
are sent in binary or ASCII format.  The second and third  bytes 
are  the values of any offset that is to be added to the row and 
column values.  

Example:  Many terminals use a one byte binary value for row and 
column  addressing.   To  avoid  sending ASCII control codes, an 
offset of 20H is added to the row or column position to get  the 
actual value sent to the terminal.

ENABLE and DISABLE  STATUS  LINE  are  used  on  terminals  that 
support  an optional 25th status line.  This can only be used by 
VEDIT if it can be addressed as a  normal  line  (i.e.  reserved 
status lines are not supported).  If this function is supported, 
VEDIT will use the 25th status line as its own status line.

ENTER and EXIT VEDIT can be used to enable a  terminal  function 
while  in VEDIT and disable that function when leaving VEDIT.  A 
common use for this function is on terminals that have a numeric 
keypad  that  can  also be used as function keys.  In this case, 
VEDIT would put the keypad in alternate (function key)  mode  in 
and upon exit return it to normal mode.

0,0,0,0,0,0,0		  Disable Status Line (not used)
