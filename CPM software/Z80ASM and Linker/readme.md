## What you'll find in this directory ##
Z80ASM and SLRNK, the macro assembler and linker, from SLR Systems. I nost of the cases you'll only need the macro assembler because it already generates an executable file for CP/M.

The subdirectory named "homemade" contains a few programs that I wrote. They were totally written and compiled in CP/M, like in the good old days.
