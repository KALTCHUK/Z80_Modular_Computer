- preTTY tests:
	- blink TX_LED.
	- card_select. if /CS, blink LED.
	- card_select. if /CS, send "*" to serial.
	- card_select. if /CS, if read_data, 		send "R" to serial.
	                       if write_data, 		send "W" to serial.
	                       if read_status, 		send "S" to serial.
	                       if write_command,	send "C" to serial.
	- preTTY.
- ESP8266. Continue tests with Telnet2serial.
- Design board with PSU, ESP8266 and relays for power-on and reset.
- Test USARTv2 (preTTY card):
	- develop routines to communicate with USARTv2
	- performance at 9600, 38400 and 115200bps (125kbps).
	- modify BIOS for new USARTv2
	- run DDT and ZSID.
	- run WS and SC.
- Rethink KEYBOARD.CNF for TeraTerm.
- Design MEM PCB.
- Connect ESP8266 to USARTv2.
- Design PCB for USARTv2.
