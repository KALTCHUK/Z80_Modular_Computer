## What you'll find in this directory ##
In each directory there's a specific software or package to run on CP/M, except for Backups directory. I tested all of them and they worked smoothly. 

Of course CP/M is not limited to only these softwares. This is what was useful for me. Search the WEB and you'll find a ton of good (and bad) software for CP/M.

Check the readme.md files in each subdirectory for more info.
