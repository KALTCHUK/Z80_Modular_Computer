- Wire-up USARTv2 with Aduino Nano on TTY0 and ATmega 328 on TTY1.
- Test USARTv2:
	- performance at 38400 and 115200bps.
	- run DDT and ZSID.
	- run WS and SC.
- Get familiar with ATMEGA328:
	- check if IC already has bootloader.
	- do the blink.
	- do the new preTTY.
- Get familiar with ESP8266:
	- do the Blink.
	- do WiFiSearch.
	- do the TelnetSerial.
	- do local telnet.
	- configure dynamic DNS.
	- do external telnet.
	- implement reset via telnet.
- Rethink KEYBOARD.CNF for TeraTerm.
- Assemble CPU and FLASHv2 PCBs.
- Test CPU and FLASHv2 PCBs.
- Design MEM PCB.
- Connect ESP8266 to USARTv2.
- Modify USART v2 to work with ATMEGA328P.
- Design PCB for USARTv2.
- Design device with ESP8266 and relays.
