I strongly recommed that you use TERATERM as your serial terminal emulator. I also tested Putty, ExtraPutty and Termite, but Teraterm was the best option. TERATERM.INI is the configuration file for Teraterm, setup as VT-100, 120 columns x 50 lines, and 250kbps baud rate.

ECHOES.TXT is a plain text, very useful to test serial communication and memory/disk operations.

_TO_DO_LIST.TXT is my to-do list, of course.

The UZI stuff is supposed to be a UNIX for Z80. I never tested it. Be my guest.
