
			WELCOME TO VEDIT PLUS 2.33
			--------------------------

	Before you get started, please read these notes.

1.  Print the file README.CRT.  It contains important notes on installing
    and using the CRT version of VEDIT PLUS.  It also contains the
    "Default" keyboard layout and example layouts for several terminals.

2.  You don't have to read the whole manual!  You generally only have to 
    perform steps 1 and 2 of the Installation (pages 298 - 301) to get 
    started.  If you have a hard disk you should also follow the instructions 
    on page 18.  Then go directly to the short tutorial beginning on page 19.

3.  Be sure to read the "ERRATA.DOC" file.  It mainly covers enhancements 
    made after the manual was printed.  You don't want to miss them!

4.  If you have a Zenith Z-100 read the file Z-100.DOC.

5.  In the rare case that your terminal is not listed in the Installation 
    menu refer to the file NEWCRT.DOC.  It explains how to make a custom 
    entry for your terminal or change an existing entry.
