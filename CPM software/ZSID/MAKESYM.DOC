The MAKESYM program included on this diskette is used to produce a .SYM
file from the Symbol Table listing provided by Z80ASM or SLRMAC.  MAKESYM
reads a .LST file, converts the symbol table to a format readable by
ZSID, DSD80, etc, and writes it to a .SYM file on the same drive.

Since extra information is included in the .LST file, such as CSEG relative
designations, or COMMON relative, external, etc, MAKESYM allows you to
specify offsets for any or all of the relative types, while stripping out
any external symbols (Only one COMMON is supported since there is no dis-
tinction between different COMMONs in the .LST table).

This is useful for intense debugging of a particular module where you would
like to have all the internal symbols available at debug time, but don't
want to go in and declare them all global.  You just tell MAKESYM where the
PROG and DATA sections were placed at link time, and there you have it.

This is also useful for generating a useable symbol table when you directly
generate the .COM or .HEX without linking.  In that case you just run MAKESYM
and don't need to specify any offsets.

To use:

A>MAKESYM FILENAME[.EXT] [/PXXXX] [/DXXXX] [/CXXXX] [/U]

where the brackets surround optional items and are not actually typed.

	/PXXXX		Here XXXX is the HEX offset for PROG relative items.

	/DXXXX		Here XXXX is the HEX offset for DATA relative items.

	/CXXXX		Here XXXX is the HEX offset for COMMON relative items.

	/U		This tells MAKESYM to perform upper-case conversion
			(Some debuggers allow lower case symbols but don't let
			you access them).

	.EXT		This is used to overide the default extension of .LST.
			Don't use .SYM (to convert .SYM to .SYM) because
			MAKESYM creates a .SYM file immediately, erasing the
			file it is trying to convert.


Have a productive day!
