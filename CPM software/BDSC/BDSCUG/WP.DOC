The WP word processor
---------------------

WP is a batch mode word processor. It is invoked as:
.sp 2
	WP <input-file> <output-file>
.sp 2
This means accept text with embedded commands from file name
<input-file> and send the processed text to <output-file>. These files
are normally CP/M disk files however if the output file is specified
to be: LST: or CON: or PUN: then the output is sent to the List device
(printer), the Console device (crt), or the Punch device respectively.
An example invocation is:
.sp 2
	WP WP.DOC LST:
.sp 2
.ti +4
The word processor accepts several commands to justify, center or simply
pass thru text. In addition it allows both a header title at the beginning
of each page and a footer title at the bottom of each page. These both
default to an empty line.
.ti + 4
Each WP command consists of 3 characters in
the leftmost column and (in most cases) an optional parameter.
Parameters are strings in the case of header and footer titles and
numbers in all other cases.
.ti +4
In the header and footer strings, leading spaces
are ignored and all occurrences of # are replaced in the output text
by the current page number. If the first non space or tab character in
a header or footer string is " or ' it will be discarded, this is a means
to allow leading spaces in the string since all spaces after the " or '
are significant.
.bp
.ti +4
The numeric parameters can be in one of two forms,
an absolute number sets the associated to that number or if out of
legal range, to its limit. A signed (+ or -) number sets the parameter
to its current value + or - the value of the number. This allows setting
for example a paragraph indent margin to be inset from the normal indent
without being required to remember where the current indent is set.
.ti +4
The default mode is
"fill" i.e. fit as many words as possible on a line to fill out the
line width, however any input lines of text which start with space or
tab maintain that number of columns of leading space.
In any case these lines with leading whitespace cause a "break" i.e.
they cause the following text to begin on a new line. Several commands
also cause a break (see table below).
.ti +4
In the function categories below
the lines referred to in centering and underlining are input lines, therefore
to cause a single word to be underlined,for instance, simply place it
on a separate input line. Likewise, to avoid the need to count lines,
centering and underlining may be
made continous by setting the number of lines to something huge e.g. 4000
until it is wished to disable them again at which point specifing 0
will cause an immediate disable.

head one char position at a time
