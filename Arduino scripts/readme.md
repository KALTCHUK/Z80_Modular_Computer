## What you'll find in this directory ##
Only Arduino scripts. Nothing relevant for the Proton assembly, except if you intend to build your own EEPROM programmer. In this case, you should take a look at EProg_1.3. There you'll find the Arduino script used on the EPROG - EEPROM Programmer, that I made. The circuit diagram and PCB layout are in the "KiCAD files" directory. It's important to note that I designed the EPROG specifically to be used with the W27C512.
