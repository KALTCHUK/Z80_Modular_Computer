- Design PSU.

- Continue tests with ESP8266.
	- work on Telnet.
	- work on Dynamic IP.
	- Connect ESP8266 to preTTY.

- Design board with ESP8266 and relays for power-on and reset.

- Write BIOS 2.0 with TTY drivers and IOBYTE implementation.

- Modify BIOS to perform disc boot instead of ROM boot.

- Design Backplane v2 (8 cards + PSU) PCB.

- Develop terminal-in-a-box with RPi.

Machanical issues:
- Design the frontal panels and 3D print them.
- Design the slotted card guide and 3D print it.
- Build the enclosure with aluminium frames.

Some ideas for new cards:
- VGA and keyboard (FPGA?)
- digital I/O for automation (8255)
- analog I/O for automation
- Real-time clock
- audio
