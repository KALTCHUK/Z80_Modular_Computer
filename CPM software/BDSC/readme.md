## What you'll find in this directory ##
C compiler and linker from BDS. It sticks very close to the original C language syntax defined by K&R, of course considering the huge differences between CP/M and UNIX. By the way, BDS stands for "Brain Damage Software".

The subdirectory named "homemade" contains a few programs that I wrote. They were totally written and compiled in CP/M, like in the good old days.
