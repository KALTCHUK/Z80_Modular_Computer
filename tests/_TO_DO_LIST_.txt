- preTTY tests:
	- blink TX_LED.
	- card_select. if /CS, blink LED.
	- card_select. if /CS, send "*" to serial.
	- card_select. if /CS, if read_data, 		send "R" to serial.
	                       if write_data, 		send "W" to serial.
	                       if read_status, 		send "S" to serial.
	                       if write_command,	send "C" to serial.
	- write preTTY.
	- develop routines to communicate with preTTY
	- test performance at 9600, 38400 and 115200bps (125kbps).
