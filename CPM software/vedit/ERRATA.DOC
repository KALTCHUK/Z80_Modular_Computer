		|    MANUAL ERRATA and Recent Changes   |
		-----------------------------------------

There are several typos in the manual which you should correct.  Several
last minute enhancements to the program are also not reflected in the manual.
We apologize for the inconvenience.

To print this file, give the DOS command:

	VPLUS -X PRINT.VDM ERRATA.DOC


Note that the on-line help files are completely up to date.



ERRATA
------

Pg. 188		Change ".lm" to ".ml".  Note that several new internal 
		values have been added.  These are described below.

Pg. 361		Change ".lm" to ".ml".  

Pg. 251		In "Notes", delete the last sentence beginning with
		"However, ...".

Pg. 302		Task (2) begins with the prompt:

		"Load new keyboard layout from the file VEDIT.KEY (Y/N)?"

		Normally answer this with "N".  See "Installation" below.

Pg. 329		(IBM PC Only)  There are two new keystroke macros:   

		<ALT-N>  Prompts for the name of a file to simultaneously
			 edit in its own window.  (The current window is
			 split into two.)

		<ALT-T>  Toggles between the files being edited.

		Note:   These keystroke macros use text register "X" and
			numeric registers 98 and 99.
		       


NEW FILES
---------

CV203.VDM	This is a macro which converts version 2.02 macros into
		2.03 macros.

STRIPV.VDM	This macro strips comments from VEDIT PLUS macros.  Primarily
		for CP/M (8080 / Z80) machines, where it is important to save
		memory space.

WHATS.NEW	Documents the changes made in VEDIT PLUS from version 2.03 to
		2.03b and from version 2.02 to 2.03.  This is primarily of
		interest to existing VEDIT users.



ENHANCEMENTS	(These technical commands are not important to new users!)
------------

EA command	The command "-EA" saves the file being edited, but leaves the 
		edit position at the beginning of the file.  (Note: the text 
		markers may not be preserved with "-EA".)

ES command	"ES 6 n" now has three settings.  The normal setting "ES 6 0" 
		writes files in their exact length; "ES 6 1" writes files with
		one EOF mark (1A hex); "ES 6 2" writes files with one EOF mark
		and padding (00 hex) to the next 128 byte boundary.

OD command	Displays the system date.  ":OD" suppresses the final <CR>
		<LF>.  Use the command "YI OD -YI" to insert the date into
		your text.

OT command	Displays the system time.  ":OD" suppresses the final <CR>
		<LF>. "+OT" displays the time with hundreth-second resolution.

V command	The command "-V" performs an update-only of the visual mode 
		window.  It is useful inside macros which need to update a 
		window.  (Otherwise visual mode windows only update while 
		waiting for keyboard input.)

YB command	"YB" rings the bell. (It sends a <CTRL-G> to DOS.)

YL command	The command form "+YL file" performs an extended search for
		the keyboard layout file 'file'.

YO command	"YO" re-routes the following console output directly to DOS.  
		"-YO" stops the re-routing.  It is unlikely you will ever 
		need this command.

YWS command	The command "YWS?" switches to use the status line as a one 
		line window.  This allows displaying messages on the status 
		line.  (It is more flexible than using "+YT", "+XQ" and 
		"+RQ".)  You should explicitly switch back to a normal window 
		when done.  (".wn" is the current window name.)

.ml value	The internal value ".ml" is the current left margin, i,e.
		the indent position in Visual Mode.

.mr value	".mr" is the current right margin, i,e. the word wrap column.
		(Same as EP 7.)
		
.ms value	".ms" is the horizontal scroll amount in visual mode, i.e. 
		the number on the left side of the status line.

.os value	".os" is the operating system type: 0 = CP/M, 1 = CP/M-86 2 = 
		MSDOS/PCDOS.  (Useful in macros which use the "OT", "OD", 
		"OC" and "OS" commands.)

.wsW value	".wsW" is the status of window "W".  It has value "1" if 
		window "W" exists, otherwise value "0".

.wz value	".wz" indicates whether any window has been zoomed to full 
		screen: 0 = not zoomed, 1 = zoomed.

Window 		You can use the value of a numeric register to specify the
commands	desired window in all window commands.  The form is:
		"YWS#r", "YWD#r", "YWB#r n", etc.  See page 198.



[CANCEL] and <CTRL-C>
---------------------

On the IBM PC, [CANCEL] can be used as an alternative to <CTRL-C> to cancel 
edit functions which are prompting on the status line.  [CANCEL] can also be 
used in place of <CTRL-C> in Command Mode to abort macros, etc.



Keystroke Macros
----------------

Keystroke macros can be used in both Visual Mode and in Command Mode.  For 
example, you could use the [DEFINE] function to assign the command "ED *.ASM 
<RETURN>" to the key <SHIFT-F1>.  Pressing <SHIFT-F1> in Command Mode would 
then execute the command.  There is one restriction: keystroke macros used in 
Command Mode cannot be accessed via multi-key "escape sequences".  This is a 
serious restriction for CRT terminals, but not for the IBM PC.

Visual Mode keystroke macros can be a combination of visual mode functions 
and Command Mode commands.  This allows virtually any edit function to be 
created.  Page 105 of the manual gives several useful examples.

Keystroke macros can be built into VEDIT PLUS during Installation.  There is 
no absolute limit to how many keystroke macros can be built in or added with 
[DEFINE].  Of course, keystroke macros take up memory space.  INSTALL limits 
the length of EACH keystroke macro to 200 characters.  The "VPLUS.COM" file 
will grow in size as keystroke macros are added.



INSTALLATION
------------

The entire keyboard layout, including any keystroke macros created with the 
[DEFINE] function, may be saved to disk from within VEDIT PLUS with the "YK" 
command.  This file may now be used to setup the keyboard layout during 
Installation.  (The file must be saved with the name "VEDIT.KEY".)

TASK (2) of the Installation now asks the following question:

	Load new keyboard layout from the file VEDIT.KEY (Y/N)?

Answer with "Y" to load the file "VEDIT.KEY" and return to the main menu.
You can then select Task 2 and/or Task 3 to futher modify the keyboard layout.

You can create keystroke macros within VEDIT PLUS, save them to disk, and use 
this Installation feature to have them "built-in".

This also makes it easier to update from one version of VEDIT PLUS to the 
next.  For example, if you are updating from 2.03 to 2.03b, you can copy the 
keyboard layout from the old VEDIT PLUS to the new one:

1.  Invoke the 2.03 VEDIT PLUS and enter Command Mode.

2.  Give the command: "YK VEDIT.KEY".

3.  Exit the editor with the command: "EQY".

4.  Give the command to install the 2.03b VEDIT PLUS: "INSTALL VPLUS.COM".

5.  Select Task 2 and enter "Y" for the first question.

6.  Exit the Installation.

(Note: this does not work with 2.02 or earlier versions of VEDIT PLUS.)



SMALL MEMORY MODE  (8086 Only)
-----------------

For optimum performance VEDIT PLUS will use a lot, or even all, of memory.  
In particular, it will try to reserve one 64K memory segment for the text 
registers, another 64K for the main edit buffer, and additional 64K segments 
for each edit buffer, until all memory is used up.  The program itself takes 
another 36K.  Normally this works best.  However, if you try to run other 
programs from within VEDIT PLUS (via the "OC" and "OS" commands), you may 
find that you don't have enough memory left.  If this happens you should 
first "quit" any unused edit buffers.  If this is not enough, you can run 
VEDIT PLUS in its "small memory mode", in which it only uses 64K of memory 
for all edit buffers and text registers.  (Total memory usage = 100K).  You 
may also want to run in "small memory mode" with multi-tasking programs such 
as TopView, Microsoft Windows or DESQView.  To run in "small memory mode", 
invoke VEDIT PLUS as follows:

	VPLUS -S filename



ERROR HANDLING  (MS-DOS Only)
--------------

VEDIT PLUS handles all disk errors, including having a disk drive door open, 
read and write errors.  It also handles printer errors.  When an error 
occurs, the status line displays a descriptive message and prompts with:

CANCEL, IGNORE, RETRY (C/I/R)?

Type "C" to cancel the operation.  This is safe because it returns to VEDIT 
PLUS.  Type "R" to re-try the operation, such as after closing the drive 
door.  You can type "I" to ignore, but this usually just leads to another 
error.



PRESERVING YOUR FILES
---------------------

VEDIT PLUS is designed to make it as unlikely as possible for you to 
accidentally lose a file or your edited text.  However, nothing is foolproof.  
The best safeguard is to save your edited file to disk at least once an hour 
(using [FILE]-Save or the "EA" command) and backing up your work at the end 
of each day.  

You should use the following commands with additional care:

1.  The "EK" command erases files similar to the DOS "ERASE" command.  "EK" 
    is actually safer to use since it displays the filenames about to be 
    erased and requests confirmation.

2.  The "EQ" and "EZ" commands and the [FILE]-Quit operation abandon the edit 
    changes you have just made.  They are very useful, but you don't want to 
    use them when you really wanted to save your changes.  These commands 
    request confirmation before throwing your text away.  Also, they do not 
    change or erase the original files on disk.

3.  The "EF" command is primarily intended for splitting large files into 
    smaller ones.  "EF" is almost always preceded by a "W" command.  Don't 
    use "EF" to quit or save your editing.  This command requests confirmation.

4.  The "OS" command lets you enter DOS for as long as you wish.  However, it
    does not save the files you are editing to disk.  Therefore, be sure to 
    return to VEDIT PLUS (with the DOS command "EXIT") to save your files.
    It is easy to forget that you are still in VEDIT PLUS and turn the
    computer off - losing your edit changes.  As a safeguard, you may wish
    to save your files (use "EY" or "EA" commands) before entering DOS.

As an additional safeguard, VEDIT PLUS always creates a "backup" when you 
revise an existing file.  The backup has a filename extension of ".BAK" and 
is created whenever you save the newest revisions to disk.  Therefore, if you 
accidentally erase an important file (either with VEDIT PLUS or DOS) you will 
still have the backup (unless you explicitly erased it).  To use the backup, 
just rename it to the desired filename; you cannot directly edit a ".BAK" 
file.
