## What you'll find in this directory ##
Each subdirectory contains the KiCAD files for a specific Proton card, assembled in the rack. They all contain the circuit diagrams. Most of them also have the PCB layouts and some even have the Gerber files I sent to the PCB manufacturers (PCBway and JLC PCB)).
