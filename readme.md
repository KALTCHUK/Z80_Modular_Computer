#Proton - Z80 Modular Computer#

##Overview##

The content of this repo is a small portion of the knowledge of two years developing the Proton Z80 Modular Computer. Most of the information and results are in my logbook - a notebook (paper, not a computer), where I write everything before executing. During this period, I was the system engineer, hardware engineer, software engineer and project manager. why did it take me so long to complete this project? Because it's a weekend hobby and also because sometimes I had to wait many weeks to receive some components and PCBs.  

About the final product.

Is it perfect? No.
Is it state of the art? No
Does I meet the initial goal? Yes.
Am I happy with it? For sure!

Github directories

All directory names are self-explaining and you'll find a readme file inside each one with some additional info.

What's most important

Well, if you want to build your own Proton Z80 Modular Computer, you'll need to check these directories:

- CPM build
- CPM software
- KiCAD files
- Monitor build
- System manuals (Proton and Monitor)
- pics

You want your own Proton? So follow these steps:

1) Order the PCBs. You can order from PCBway with the codes in the Proton Manual.
2) Buy the components according to the bill of materials in the Proton Manual.
3) Download the software from Github.
4) Burn the EEPROM.
5) Configure the jumpers on the cards according to instructions in the Proton Manual.

Ready to start! Now you can transfer all the CP/M software from your computer to the Proton.

Inside the Proton Manual there's a section called "Getting Started" which describes in details all the steps listed above. I suggest you read ALL the manual before starting.
