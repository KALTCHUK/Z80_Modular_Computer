                             The WP word processor
                             ---------------------
              WP is a batch mode word processor. It is invoked as: 


        WP <input-file> <output-file> 


          This means accept text with embedded commands from file name 
          <input-file>  and  send the processed text to <output-file>.
          These files are normally CP/M  disk  files  however  if  the
          output  file  is  specified to be: LST: or CON: or PUN: then
          the output is sent to the List device (printer), the Console 
          device (crt), or the Punch device respectively.  An  example
          invocation is: 


        WP WP.DOC LST: 


              The  word processor accepts several commands to justify,
          center or simply pass thru text. In addition it allows  both
          a  header  title  at the beginning of each page and a footer
          title at the bottom of each page. These both default  to  an
          empty line. 
              Each WP command consists of 3 characters in the leftmost 
          column and (in most cases) an optional parameter. Parameters 
          are  strings  in  the  case  of header and footer titles and
          numbers in all other cases. 
              In the header and footer  strings,  leading  spaces  are
          ignored  and all occurrences of # are replaced in the output
          text by the current page number. If the first non  space  or
          tab character in a header or footer string is " or ' it will 
          be discarded, this is a means to allow leading spaces in the 
          string since all spaces after the " or ' are significant.

              The  numeric  parameters  can be in one of two forms, an
          absolute number sets the associated to that number or if out 
          of legal range, to its limit. A signed (+ or -) number  sets
          the  parameter  to its current value + or - the value of the
          number. This allows setting for example a  paragraph  indent
          margin  to  be  inset  from  the normal indent without being
          required to remember where the current indent is set. 
              The default mode is "fill" i.e. fit  as  many  words  as
          possible  on  a line to fill out the line width, however any
          input lines of text which start with space or  tab  maintain
          that  number  of columns of leading space. In any case these
          lines with leading whitespace  cause  a  "break"  i.e.  they
          cause  the  following  text  to begin on a new line. Several
          commands also cause a break (see table below). 
              In the function categories below the lines  referred  to
          in  centering  and underlining are input lines, therefore to
          cause a single word to be  underlined,for  instance,  simply
          place  it  on  a separate input line. Likewise, to avoid the
          need to count lines, centering and underlining may  be  made
          continous  by  setting the number of lines to something huge
          e.g. 4000 until it is wished to disable them again at  which
          point specifing 0 will cause an immediate disable.

    note:
          underlining works only for printers which can back up the print
