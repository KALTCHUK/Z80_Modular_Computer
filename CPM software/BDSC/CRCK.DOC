CRCK.COM
--------

A Checksum program, CRCK.COM, is provided to verify that all files in
the BDS C package survived shipment intact.

The usage of CRCK.COM is as follows:

CRCK <afn>		--  displays checksum for all files that match the
			    specification

CRCK <afn> f		--  If a second parameter being the letter "F" follows
			    the <afn>, then a file named CRCKLIST.CRC is
			    written to disk containing all the checksum info
			    that was displayed on the console.

Note that you should have backed up the original distribution disks before
running CRCK with the "f" option, or else the new CRCKLIST.CRC might wipe
out the original copy supplied on the master distribution disks.
