                Creative Computing's BASIC Games
                --------------------------------

This is a collection of BASIC games from the early days of hobby
computing and the famed 'Creative Computing' magazine.

The games are text-only (no graphics!) and include many classic
BASIC games of the era. The games will run on most versions of
Microsoft BASIC, including MBASIC, BASICA, GW-BASIC etc.

The programs were found scattered among several CP/M software
archives and appear to have been part of a disk-based collection
of BASIC games published by Creative Computing in about 1982.
Originally supplied in tokenised MBASIC form, each game has been
converted to pure ASCII to allow its use by most Microsoft
Basic interpreters. Organised as two-disk collection, a loader
program MENU.BAS is used to access all games on each disk.

As an original source of the Creative Computing games could not
be found, it is possible that some games may have been modified
or are missing. The only requirement for a game's inclusion in
this collection is that it contained the Creative Computing
sign-on message.
